# GOLEM Lab
The "Graphs and Ontologies for Literary Evolution Models" is a 5-year research project funded by the European Commission (ERC StG).

The **goal** of the project is to create accurate models of how the (formal and content-related) cultural traits of fiction spread and combine. The data used are fanfiction stories in 5 different languages (English, Spanish, Italian, Korean, and Indonesian) gathered from various online platforms.

The **methodology** combines mainly computational literary studies and cultural evolution theory, with influences from fan studies and information science.

The project is hosted by the Center for Langugage and Cognition and the Center for Digital Humanities of the University of Groningen (Netherlands).
